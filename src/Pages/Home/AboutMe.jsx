            I'm Tyler, a current student of Computer Science & Business
            Administration at the University of Southern California. I started
            my programming journey a couple of years ago during my freshman year
            of university, and now I've found a strong passion in computer
            science and engineering. I enjoy solving problems and building new
            things with the tools I've learned and I hope to continue this
            journey many years into the future.
          </p>

            Some other things I like to do in my free time is to play piano and
            guitar, go hiking or to the gym, and to cook or try new restaurants
            around LA!
